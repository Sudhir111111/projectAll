Project Setup:
Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
Add necessary dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Eureka Server, Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Config Server, Spring Data JPA, etc.
Flight Reservation Microservice:

Develop a microservice to manage flight reservations.
Define REST endpoints for creating, updating, and fetching reservations.
Implement data persistence using Spring Data JPA and a database (e.g., MySQL).
User Authentication with Spring Security:

Configure Spring Security for user authentication and authorization.
Implement user registration and login functionality.
Secure the REST endpoints based on user roles.
Eureka Server for Service Discovery:

Create a Eureka Server to act as a service registry.
Register the Flight Reservation microservice with the Eureka Server.
Enable other microservices to discover and communicate with each other.
API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway):

Develop an API Gateway to handle incoming requests and route them to appropriate microservices.
Implement load balancing and routing rules for different services.
Spring Cloud Config Server:

Set up a Spring Cloud Config Server to manage externalized configuration.
Store configuration files in a Git repository and configure the Config Server to fetch configurations.
Microservices Communication:

Implement communication between microservices using REST APIs or messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka).
Handle service-to-service communication securely and efficiently.
Frontend (Optional):

Create a frontend application using a technology like Angular or React.
Integrate the frontend with the REST APIs provided by the microservices.
Testing and Validation:

Write unit tests and integration tests for each microservice.
Test the entire system to ensure proper communication and functionality.
Deployment and Scaling:

Deploy each microservice separately using containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
Set up multiple instances of microservices to demonstrate scalability.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging using tools like Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.
Monitor the health and performance of microservices.
Security and Authorization:

Implement OAuth2-based token authentication for securing microservices.
Define roles and permissions to control access to resources.
Configuring the Config Server:

Configure the Spring Cloud Config Server to fetch configuration files from the Git repository.
Store environment-specific configurations.
Documentation and Testing:

Create documentation for API endpoints, configurations, and deployment instructions.
Test the application thoroughly to ensure all components work seamlessly.
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):

Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying microservices.
Load Testing and Performance Tuning (Optional):

Conduct load testing to evaluate the system's performance under heavy loads.
Identify bottlenecks and optimize the system accordingly.
